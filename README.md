# **Enterprise VLAN Network Security Architecture**  

## **Overview**  
This repository provides an in-depth implementation of a **secure VLAN-based enterprise network architecture** with **VPN integration, firewall security, and cloud connectivity**. It is designed to segment network traffic efficiently, improve security, and ensure optimal network performance across different departments.  

## **Key Components**  

### üî• **Security Appliance**  
- Acts as the central **firewall** to filter and control traffic between VLANs.  
- Enforces **access control policies** to secure internal communication.  
- Integrates **VPN connectivity** for remote access and cloud security.  

### üåê **VPN & Internet Access**  
- Provides **remote access** through a **VPN tunnel** for secure external connections.  
- Connects to **cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Rackspace) for scalability.  

### **VLAN Segmentation**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Management VLAN (MGMT VLAN 10)**  
   - Isolated network for **administrators and critical servers**.  
   - Ensures **restricted access** to configuration interfaces and network devices.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Peer-to-Peer VLAN (Peer VLAN 20)**  
   - Facilitates **internal workstation communication** among employees.  
   - Controls access between **shared resources and personal devices**.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Device VLAN (Device VLAN 30)**  
   - Contains **network peripherals** such as **printers, IP cameras, and IoT devices**.  
   - Implements **traffic filtering** to prevent unauthorized device access.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Telecommunications VLAN (Telco VLAN 40)**  
   - Dedicated to **VoIP phones and telecom equipment**.  
   - Ensures **Quality of Service (QoS)** for stable voice and video communication.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Point-of-Sale VLAN (POS VLAN 50)**  
   - Segregates **POS terminals and payment processing devices**.  
   - Prevents **financial transaction interference** with other network traffic.  

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Storage VLAN (Storage VLAN 60)**  
   - Hosts **network storage and backup servers**.  
   - Implements **data encryption & redundancy** for disaster recovery.  

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Trade VLAN (Trade VLAN 90)**  
   - Reserved for **business-critical applications and financial transactions**.  
   - Restricts access based on **user roles and security policies**.  

8Ô∏è‚É£ **Guest VLAN (Guest VLAN 99)**  
   - Isolated network for **visitor and temporary device connections**.  
   - Provides **limited internet access** without compromising internal security.  

## **Security Implementation**  
‚úÖ **Firewall Policies**: Restricts unauthorized cross-VLAN access.  
‚úÖ **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Enforces user-based network permissions.  
‚úÖ **Intrusion Detection & Prevention (IDS/IPS)**: Monitors for security threats.  
‚úÖ **VPN Encryption**: Secures remote traffic with **SSL/TLS protocols**.  
‚úÖ **Cloud Integration Security**: Protects **data exchange** with cloud services.  

## **Installation & Configuration**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ VLAN Configuration Example (Cisco Switch)**  
```sh
enable
configure terminal
vlan 10
 name MGMT_VLAN
vlan 20
 name PEER_VLAN
vlan 30
 name DEVICE_VLAN
vlan 40
 name TELCO_VLAN
vlan 50
 name POS_VLAN
vlan 60
 name STORAGE_VLAN
vlan 90
 name TRADE_VLAN
vlan 99
 name GUEST_VLAN
exit
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Assign VLANs to Ports**  
```sh
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
exit
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Inter-VLAN Routing (on Layer 3 Switch)**  
```sh
interface Vlan10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
```
